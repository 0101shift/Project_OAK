**An approach in bringing Mechanical complications to Digital timepieces.**

* Designing a normal analog watch with digital parts is basic but, recreating one of the mechanical complications 
  into a digital watch would be interesting. 
* Mechanical complications like Minute Repeater, GMT & moon phase are considered a few cool complications that have ever been designed in mechanical watches.
    * Minute Repeater is a complication where the watch indicates time through chimes.
    * GMT complication help you to track one more additional time zone along with current one.
    * Moon-phase complication helps you to keep track on full-moon.
* Though these complications are already available in smartwatches, recreating them locally with little hardware logic is cool. 
* To make it cooler, the whole watch body is going to be made from PCBs with suitable colour and finish to give the analog touch.
* The very initial version will be just a simple watch features Time display functions. With further learning from initial version, GMT & Minute repeater complications are added in upcoming version.
* Also, there will be some digital sensors to create some interaction with the user. (future use case)
* The initial variant will be powered by 3V Coin cell. Later versions may opt for rechargeable battery.
